## About Me

I am a full-stack software engineer. After graduating from the University of Washington with a B.A. majoring in Psychology, I changed career paths and began studying software development. I attended the App Academy boot camp and gained 1000+ hours of experience learning about computer science and creating multiple full-stack projects. I love learning new technologies and developing software, and I have experience working in teams, as an employee, and as a leader. 

Currently, I am looking for an entry-level position to join to technology sector on a professional level. I have experience creating full-stack applications using React and TypeScript for the client side and creating the server side with either Python or JavaScript, as well as using Sequelize and SQLAlchemy for database management.

Some of my interests apart from software development include history, reading, word games, stand-up comedy, and music.
